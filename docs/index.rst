GFS Data Tool
*************
The GFS Data Tool is a tool that handles downloading, processing, visualizing, analyzing, and sharing the most recent
GFS 1/4 degree forecasts. The tool provides visual and programmatic access to the data across all variable and levels
but not across varied measurement depths.

The tool is a Tethys application with a python workflow that can be run on regular intervals to download, process, and
expose the most recent forecast data. The app provides REST API endpoints enabling the code to be run locally, deployed
through a GUI on a tethys potral, and run through a REST API through a language of choice. Tethys Platform is an
open-source software developed at Brigham Young University in the Hydroinformatics Lab. Tethys makes it easier to
develop and deploy web-apps for scientific data, especially geospatial and water resources related datasets.
